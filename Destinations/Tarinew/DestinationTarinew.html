        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Tarinew is located in the south-central and western region of the continent of Dahl. Named after
            <a href="../../MajorPeople/Tarindor.html">Tarindor</a>, Tarinew is home to Tarinites of all classes,
            races, and backgrounds.
        </p>
        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <p>
            As Tarinew is by far the largest unified principality in all of Dahl, the geography will vary based on which area
            you are in. Toward the southern shores of the Taridan Ocean, fishing villages and small fruit farms populate the
            flat land. The moisture in the air along with the tender care that Tarinite farmers take makes this soil fertile
            for the sweet fruits which the Tarinew shores are most notable known for.<br>
            Toward the northern region of Tarinew, the climate gets much cooler as hilly and even mountainous regions become
            apparent. While warm, mild summers grace the southern shores, harsh northern winters have been known to keep most
            Tarinites indoors during the Hollyvale season, with the exception of the Elnora festival.
